## HappnHere

Goa’s vibrant and diverse event scene is often fragmented and under-promoted. Tourists and even locals miss out on exciting activities simply because they’re not aware of what’s happening nearby. Grassroots events such as free or low-cost community gatherings, cultural performances like Tiatrs and Nataks, independent shows by local artists or performers with small fanbases, and various social, technical, or educational meetups are typically under-promoted or scattered across multiple unorganized platforms. As a result, many people miss out not just due to limited visibility, but also because they lack company or are unaware of communities that share their interests.
